I was on my way to the Baeckerei
When I saw an ad that Rammstein was going to be performing at the olympiastadion in Berlin this summer.
So I went over to the Haupstrasse and started heading towards the Flughafen
Hoping to find wettbewerbsfaehig pricing on airline tickets to Berlin.
The pricing was not wettbewerbsfaehig, but then I realized the baeckerei in the flughafen has apfelkuchen.
