I was on my way to the Baeckerei
When I saw an ad that Rammstein was going to be performing at the olympiastadion in Berlin this summer.
So I went over to the Haupstrasse and started heading towards the Flughafen
Hoping to find wettbewerbsfaehig pricing on airline tickets to Berlin.
The pricing was not wettbewerbsfaehig, but then I realized the baeckerei in the flughafen has apfelkuchen.
When some guy in lederhose rolled up in his Porsche, blasting "Du Hast" (one of Rammstein's songs) from his stereo.
I raced the guy in my BMW M3 on the autobahn and he no longer looked cool.
Yes he was faster than me, but when he started showing off by racing backwards, a stray Bratwurst got lodged in his tail pipe!
